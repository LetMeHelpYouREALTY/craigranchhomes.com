                The Ridges: Las Vegas's Ultimate Address for Discerning Buyers
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>The Ridges</strong> represents the pinnacle of Las Vegas luxury living. Nestled
                within Summerlin along the foothills of Red Rock Canyon, this ultra-exclusive guard-gated
                community offers estate-quality homes with panoramic views of the Las Vegas Strip, the
                surrounding mountains, and the pristine desert landscape. When the most discerning buyers
                search for Las Vegas luxury, they turn to <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong>—the
                brand that matches The Ridges' standard of excellence.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ridges comprises six distinctive villages—Bear's Best, Falcon Ridge, Azure, Talon Ridge,
                Silver Ridge, and Eagle Hills—each offering its own character while maintaining the
                community's legendary standards. With only 900 home sites across 793 acres, exclusivity is
                built into The Ridges' DNA. Strict architectural guidelines ensure that every home meets
                the community's exacting standards, protecting property values and ensuring a cohesive
                aesthetic throughout.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties</strong> has represented buyers
                and sellers in The Ridges since the community's inception. Dr. Jan Duffy understands that
                luxury transactions require more than market knowledge—they demand discretion, sophisticated
                marketing, and access to qualified buyers worldwide. The BHHS global network connects The
                Ridges properties with high-net-worth individuals actively seeking premier real estate
                investments in Las Vegas.

                    Bear's Best Golf Club, designed by Jack Nicklaus, winds through the community, adding

                The current Ridges market shows <strong>42 active listings</strong> with homes averaging
                <strong> 67 days on market</strong>—longer than the valley average, reflecting the careful
                consideration luxury buyers give to properties at this level. The median price of
                <strong> $2.5 million</strong> represents exceptional value compared to comparable
                communities in California or Hawaii. Properties range from $1.5 million to over $15
                million for the most spectacular custom estates.

                Working with <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> in The Ridges means working
                with agents who understand that luxury isn't just about price—it's about lifestyle,
                privacy, and attention to detail. Dr. Jan Duffy provides the white-glove service that
                Ridges buyers and sellers expect, from confidential off-market transactions to coordination
                with architects, designers, and property managers. When the stakes are measured in millions,
                the Berkshire Hathaway name provides the trust and expertise that matters.
