                Green Valley: Where Henderson Families Have Thrived for 35+ Years
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Green Valley</strong> holds a special place in Henderson's history as the city's
                original master-planned community. Established in 1988, Green Valley pioneered the concept
                of thoughtfully designed neighborhoods in Southern Nevada—long before master-planned
                communities became the norm. Today, <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong>
                continues to serve Green Valley buyers, helping new residents discover what long-time
                residents already know: mature trees, golf, and a Henderson location with 15–25 minute Strip drives.
              </p>
              <p>
                What makes Green Valley unique is something that can't be replicated: time. Over three
                decades, the community has matured into a verdant oasis with towering trees, established
                landscaping, and HOA-maintained parks. While newer communities offer newer amenities,
                Green Valley offers named campuses such as Green Valley High School,
                35-year-old street trees, and HOA amenities that have been operating since the late 1980s.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Nevada Properties</strong> agents have been selling
                homes in Green Valley since the beginning. Dr. Jan Duffy knows which streets offer the strongest
                mountain views, named campuses such as Green Valley High School, and which HOAs publish
                current reserve studies. This local knowledge, combined with the
                resources and reputation of BHHS, gives Green Valley buyers and sellers a distinct advantage.

                    privacy, and a sense of permanence. Many homes feature larger lots than you'll find in
                    newer developments, with mature fruit trees and professional landscaping.

                Working with a <strong>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</strong> agent in Green Valley
                means understanding the subtle differences between Green Valley proper, Green Valley Ranch,
                and Green Valley South. Each area has distinct characteristics, price points, and lifestyle
                offerings. Dr. Jan Duffy helps buyers navigate these nuances and find the right fit—whether
                that's a first purchase or a lower-maintenance resale without leaving Green Valley.
